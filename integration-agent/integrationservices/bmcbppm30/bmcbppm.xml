   | For improved performance, services can concurrently process inbound 
   | APXML messages (from both APClient and AlarmPoint).  Messages are grouped 
   | in two stages: first, by priority and second, by process group.  
   | Messages  within the same group are processed sequentially in a 
   | first-come-first-served order, while messages in different groups are 
   | processed concurrently.
   |
   | NOTE: The two stage grouping means that normal and high priority messages 
   | are always processed concurrently, regardless of whether they are in 
   | the same process group.
   |
   | NOTE: A message's priority is specified by the apia_priority token, whose
   | value is either "normal" or "high".  A message without such a token 
   | defaults to "normal" priority.
   |
   | NOTE: A message's process group is specified by the apia_process_group 
   | token, whose value is an application-defined string.  Message's without 
   | such a token are grouped together.
   |
   | NOTE: Thread counts must be positive integers.
